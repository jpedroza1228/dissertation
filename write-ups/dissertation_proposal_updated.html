# Background



---

# Physical Inactivity as a Public Health Problem

- A large percentage of the United States are not meeting recommended amounts of physical activity (Troiano et al., 2008)

- Phyiscal activity is a risk factor for several chronic health diseases, like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, several types of cancer, and symptoms of psychological disorders (Knight, 2012; Piercy et al., 2018)

- Being active reduces risk of depression, anxiety, heart disease, heart failure, and premature mortality (Da Silva et al., 2012; Kraus et al., 2019), even with modest amounts of physical activity (Arem et al., 2015)

---

## Correlates of Physical Activity

- Latinx and Black/African American adults engage in less leisure-time physical activity than White adults (Kaczynski et al., 2011; Marquez et al., 2010)

- More social support correlates with more physical activity, while a lack of social support is a barrier for physical activity (Cerin et al., 2010; Wendel-Vos et al., 2007)

- Crime is a considerable barrier to physical activity, with parks being feared as not safe (Shinew et al., 2013; Stodolska et al., 2013)

---

## Limited Access and Physical Activity

- Inconsistent findings across the literature due to various definitions of access (Bancroft et al., 2015; Wendel-Vos et al., 2007)

- Distance to the closest park was not associated with physical activity, but having recreational facilities was associated with park use and physical activity (Kaczynski et al., 2014)

- Distance to parks was not significant, but having more parks in a given area was associated with more moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (Sallis et al., 2016)

- Recreational facilities have also not correlated with physical activity in Ottawa neighborhoods (Prince et al., 2012), but when examining a larger geographic area (several metropolitan areas), this association was significant (Ranchod et al., 2014)

---

## Correlates of Access to Recreational Resources

- Potential inequities for marginalized groups like Latinx and Black/African American communities, as well as low-income communities

- There is less access to recreational facilities in census tracts with more Latinx, Black/African Americans, and lower incomes (Jones et al., 2015)
  + Latinx and Black/African Americans tend to have more access to parks (Jones et al., 2015); however, these parks are of lower quality (Rigolon, 2016)
  
- There are inequitable ditributions of access to these marginalized groups, with recreational facilities being less common, but parks and free to use facilities being more prominent (Moore et al., 2008)

# Rationale for Current Study

---

# Framework

- Using a theoretical framework rather than a single theory
  + May only use one or two different levels (Sallis et al., 2015)

- By examining several factors, ecological models can lead to implications of how to incorporate changes for factors at different levels

- A recent review of review found that the majority of reviews found that personal factors, like age and health status, as well as environmental factors, were strong correlates of physical activity engagement (Choi et al., 2017)

---

# Gaps in the Literature

- There is extensive literature on correlates of physical activity, but these studies tend to be a small sample in a small geographic area
  + When studies do account for differences between geographic areas, it tends to focus on differences between neighborhoods
  
- By comparing larger geographic areas (e.g., states), we will be able to create implications that could help a larger audience

- Examining differences in years could provide evidence of whether the United States was doing something to improve physical activity or improve the correlates to examine policy changes within that time
  
- Examining these correlates at a national level will support the need to address specific correlates across the United States for both access and physical activity



---

# Current Study Aims

1. Examine if more access to recreational resources is associated with increased leisure-time physical activity across the United States

2. Investigate if this association changes from 2016 and 2020, as well as if this association changes between states

3. Determine which factors are associated with leisure-time physical activity

4. Determine which factors are associated with access to recreational resources

# Research Questions &amp; Hypotheses

---

- RQ1: Is access to recreational resources associated with leisure-time physical activity on a national level?
  + RQ1a: How does this association change from 2016 and 2020?

- H1: Increased access to recreational resources will be associated with increased leisure-time physical activity at a national level while adjusting for state-level variation.

- H2: The strength of the association between access to recreational resources and increased leisure-time physical activity will be weaker in 2020 compared to 2016 while adjusting for county-level correlates and state-level variation.

---

- RQ2: What are the county-level correlates of leisure-time physical activity on a national level?

- H3: Higher: 1) percentage rurality, 2) percentage of Latinx residents, 4) percentage of Black/African American residents, 5) rates of violent crimes, 6) percentage of older adults, 7) percentage of adults with poor or fair health, as well as lower median household incomes and less social associations will be associated with less leisure-time physical activity engagement at a national level while adjusting for state-level variation.

# Methods


---

# Participants

- Unit of measurment for this study are all counties in the United States
  + 2016: N = 3141, 1
  + 2020: N = 3142, 1
  
- Data was gathered through the [County Health Rankings](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/)
  + Provides yearly estimates of various health behaviors, outcomes, and other correlates of health at the county level
  + Sources of data from previous years were used to create estimates for 2016 and 2020
  + Statistical modeling was conducted for any variables with counties that had low numbers of survey responses
    + counties with low response rates or small county populations were more likely to have estimates derived from the modeling techniques than survey responses

# Measures

---

# County-level Correlates

### Percent Rurality

- Measured through percentage of each county defined as rural
- Census population estimates from 2010
- Rural defined as "all population, housing; and territory not included within an urban area”
  + Area that is under 2,500 in a given area
  
### Violent Crime Rates

- Number of violent crimes reported per 100,000
- Uniform Crime Reporting - FBI
- Rates measure the number of events in a given time period
  + 2010 &amp; 2012 data for 2016 estimates
  + 2014 &amp; 2016 data for 2020 estimates
- Crimes counted in the county where the crime occurred

---

### Percentage of Latinx Residents

- Census Population Estimates
  + 2014 for 2016 estimates
  + 2018 for 2020 estimates
- Changed from Hispanic to Latinx, but describes any individual that identifies as Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, other Hispanic, or Hispanic of unknown origin

$$ Population + Births - Deaths + Migration = Estimates $$

### Percentage of Black/African American Residents

- Follows the same equation to collect estimates of Black/African American residents in a given county

---

### Social Associations

- Number of membership associations per 10,000 individuals
- County Business Patterns
  + 2013 for 2016 estimates
  + 2017 for 2020 estimates
- Included membership to groups such as fitness centers, civic organizations, religious organizations, political organizations, etc.

### Median Household Income

- Defined as income where half of households earn more while half of households earn less within a given county
- Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates
  + 2014 for 2016 estimates
  + 2018 for 2020 estimates
- Incomes could be from wages or salaries, self-employment, estate and trusts, public assistance, or disability pensions

---

### Percentage of Individuals Age 65 and older

- Census Population Estimates
  + 2014 for 2016 estimates
  + 2018 for 2020 estimates
- Used the same formula as the Latinx and Black/African American percentages.


### Percentage of adults in Poor/Fair Health

- Adults that consider their health to be of poor or fair status
- Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
  + 2014 for 2016 estimates
  + 2017 for 2020 estimates
- Adjusted based on age

---

### Access to Recreational Resources

- Access assessed through the percentage of individuals in a given county that live close to a location to engage in physical activity
- Proximity to recreational resources were considered:
  + In a census block that was within a half mile of a park
  + In an urban census block that is within one mile of a recreational facility
  + In a rural census block that is within three miles of a recreational facility
- Business Analyst, Delorme map data, ESRI, and United States Census Tigerline Files
  + 2010 and 2014 for 2016 estimates
  + 2010 and 2019 for 2020 estimates
    + 2010 values are of populations within census blocks
    + 2014 and 2019 values are of adequate access
- Changed from access to exercise opportunities to access to recreational resources

---

### Leisure-time Physical Activity

- Assessed by the number of individuals in a given county that engaged in some leisure-time physical activity
- Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System aggregated into the CDC's Diabetes Interactive Atlas (2012) and the United States Surveillance System (2016)
  + 2012 for 2016 estimates
  + 2016 for 2020 estimates
- Originally a measure of physical inactivity; however subtracted the percentage of inactivity to get percentage of those engaging in leisure-time physical activity

# Addressing Missing Data

- Multiple imputation through chained equations will be conducted
  + Multi-level imputation to address the nested nature of the data (Grund et al., 2018)
    + Requires different imputation methods at each level, but our data is only at the county level (Enders et al., 2016)

---

# Model Assumptions

- Multi-level models' assumptions are slightly different from traditional regression models (i.e., OLS)
- Assess linearity of the associations tested (ecological predictors and leisure-time physical activity)
- Examine the independence of residual errors
- Examine univariate and multivariate normality
- Test homoscedasticity by examining residual variance 
- Investigate outliers in data

---

# Analyses

- Two-level models with counties (level 1) nested within states (level 2)
- Random-intercept and random-slope models
  + The slopes of the associations for the states do not differ
  + The slopes of the associations between access and leisure-time physical activity are allowed to differ by state
- Maximum likelihood Estimation
- Likelihood ratio tests will be conducted to examine differences between competing models
  + A significant test will assess whether the inclusion/exclusion of fixed and random effects resulted in a better fitting model
- Intraclass correlation coefficients will assess how much variation is from differences between states in random-intercept models

---

# Expected Implications

### Practice

- Will provide some information for which predictors of physical activity may be of importance to practitioners within the context of their city, district, county, etc.

### Policy

- Will provide support for the importance of fund allocation and policies to improve leisure-time physical activity by addressing significant predictors

### Research

- This study will lead to future studies being able to utilize this county-level data along with individual and/or neighborhood data to get a more comprehensive picture of what is driving low levels of physical activity


---


# Strengths &amp; Limitations

### Strengths

- First study to examine correlates of access and physical activity using national data
- Will be able to examine association between access and physical activity nationally and across states

### Limitations

- Inability to examine the data longitudinally
- The geographic level may be too large to see meaningful differences
- Limitations in how the measures are assessing each construct
