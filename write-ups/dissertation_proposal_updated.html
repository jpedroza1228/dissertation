# Background



---

## Physical Inactivity as a Public Health Problem

- Over 95% of adults are not meeting the recommended amounts of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity in the United States (Troiano et al., 2008)
  + Inactivity among Latinx (66.6%) and Black/African American adults (66.1%) is significantly higher than non-Latinx White adults (52.4%; Carlson et al., 2010)

- Physical inactivity is a risk factor for several chronic health diseases, like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, several types of cancer, and symptoms of psychological disorders (Knight, 2012; Piercy et al., 2018)

- Being active reduces risk of depression, anxiety, heart disease, heart failure, and premature mortality (Da Silva et al., 2012; Kraus et al., 2019), even with modest amounts of physical activity (Arem et al., 2015)

- Leisure-time physical activity is the activity individuals engage in during their disposable time (Steinbach &amp; Graf, 2008)
  + This study's focus on leisure-time physical activity is due to leisure-time physical activity being more modifiable than other types of physical activity (e.g., occupational, transportation-based physical activity) and is associated with better health outcomes (Holtermann et al., 2018)

### Individual-level Correlates
- There are higher rates of leisure-time physical activity in individuals with more self-efficacy (Ayotte et al., 2010)
- Individuals who report better self-rated health also report being more physically active (Meyer et al., 2014)

### Interpersonal-level Correlates
- Membership in fitness and sports clubs have shown positive outcomes with adults engaging in more physical activity and exercise (Schroeder et al., 2017; Zimmermann-Sloutskis et al., 2010)
- Social support has been shown to have a positive association with physical activity (Cerin et al., 2010; Wendel-Vos et al., 2007)

### Environmental-level Correlates
- Crime is a considerable barrier to physical activity (Shinew et al., 2013; Stodolska et al., 2013)
- Rurality is another barrier to physical activity engagement, as adults in rural areas are less likely to be active (Martin et al., 2005)

**Gap:** There is a need to examine various levels of the socio-ecological model (Bronfenbrenner, 1999; Sallis et al., 2006) simultaneously rather than only focusing on individual-level correlates or environmental-level correlates (Choi et al., 2017); which this study addresses on a national level

## Access to Recreational Resources and Physical Activity

- Access to recreational resources is defined as the availability of resources to be more active including parks, trails, and recreational facilities (e.g., gyms, community centers, pools) 

- Inconsistent findings across the literature due to various definitions of access (Bancroft et al., 2015; Wendel-Vos et al., 2007)

- Distance to the closest park was not associated with physical activity, but having recreational facilities was associated with park use and physical activity (Kaczynski et al., 2014)
  + Facilities included playgrounds, sports fields, fitness stations, trails, and dog parks

- While distance to parks didn't correlate with moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity, having more parks within a kilometer of individuals' homes did (Sallis et al., 2016)

- Recreational facilities have also not correlated with physical activity in Ottawa neighborhoods (Prince et al., 2012), but when examining a larger geographic area (several metropolitan areas), this association was significant (Ranchod et al., 2014)

---

- Inconsistent findings could be due to confounding variables in this association

- Past studies have found that areas with more Latinx and Black/African American individuals, as well as lower income areas had less access to recreational facilities (Jones et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2008)


- **Gap:** The findings between access to recreational resources and leisure-time physical activity are inconsistent, primarily due to the focus on small geographic areas (e.g., neighborhoods, cities), which may not differ much
  + Examining on a larger scale, such as states, may reveal patterns in this association, which could then be used to inform interventions/practices among these smaller geographic areas.

- **Gap:** Past studies' findings that have examined the associations between race/ethnicity, income, and access to recreational resources (Jones et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2008) may result from artifacts of the locations sampled
  +   Examining on a national level provides robust estimates across the United States and provides the opportunity to compare states' access to recreational resources

_make sure to state that access is the environmental correlate of interest_
_discuss a take home point of why these inconsistent findings_
_Potential inequities for marginalized groups like Latinx and Black/African American communities, as well as low-income communities_

- **RQ1b:** Does this association vary between states? 

- **H1b:** The hypothesized positive association between access to recreational resources and increased leisure-time physical activity will significantly differ between states (Turrell et al., 2010) while adjusting for county-level correlates.

![associations](all_associations.png)

---

- **RQ2:** What are the county-level correlates of leisure-time physical activity on a national level?

- **H2:** I hypothesize that counties with higher rural percentages (Martin et al., 2005), counties with higher percentage of Latinx and Black/African American residents (Marquez et al., 2010), counties with higher rates of violent crimes (Janke et al., 2016), as well as lower county-level median household incomes (Kari et al., 2015) and counties with lower rates of social associations (Zimmermann-Sloutskis et al., 2010) will be associated with lower percentages of leisure-time physical activity engagement at a national level while adjusting for state-level variation.

![associations](all_associations.png)

---

- **R3:** What are the county-level correlates of access to recreational resources on a national level?

- **H3:** I hypothesize that counties with higher rural percentages (Anderson et al., 2015), counties with higher percentage of Latinx residents (Jones et al., 2015), counties with higher percentage of Black/African American (Jones et al., 2015), as well as lower county-level median household incomes (Jones et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2008) will be associated with less access to recreational resources while adjusting for state-level variation.

# Methods

---

# Participants

- Unit of measurement for this study are all counties in the United States
  + 2016: *N* = 3141
  + 2020: *N* = 3142
  
- Data were accessed through the [County Health Rankings](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/)
  + Provides yearly estimates of various health behaviors, outcomes, and other correlates of health at the county level
  + Sources of data from previous years were used to create estimates for 2016 and 2020
  + Statistical modeling was conducted for any variables with counties that had low numbers of survey responses
    + counties with low response rates or small county populations were more likely to have estimates derived from the modeling techniques than survey responses

# Measures

---

# County-level Correlates

### Percent Rurality

- Measured through percentage of each county defined as rural
- Census population estimates from 2010
- Rural defined as "all population, housing; and territory not included within an urban area”
  + Area that is under 2,500 in a given area
  
### Violent Crime Rates

- Number of violent crimes reported per 100,000 individuals
- Uniform Crime Reporting - FBI
- Rates measure the number of events in a given time period
  + 2010 &amp; 2012 data for 2016 estimates
  + 2014 &amp; 2016 data for 2020 estimates
- Crimes counted in the county where the crime occurred

---

### Percentage of Latinx Residents

- Census Population Estimates
  + 2014 for 2016 estimates
  + 2018 for 2020 estimates
- Changed from Hispanic to Latinx, but describes any individual that identifies as Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, other Hispanic, or Hispanic of unknown origin

$$ Population + Births - Deaths + Migration = Estimates $$

### Percentage of Black/African American Residents

- Follows the same equation to collect estimates of Black/African American residents in a given county

---

### Social Associations

- Number of membership associations per 10,000 individuals
- County Business Patterns
  + 2013 for 2016 estimates
  + 2017 for 2020 estimates
- Included membership to groups such as fitness centers, civic organizations, religious organizations, political organizations, etc.

### Median Household Income

- Defined as income where half of households earn more while half of households earn less within a given county
- Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates
  + 2014 for 2016 estimates
  + 2018 for 2020 estimates
- Incomes could be from wages or salaries, self-employment, estate and trusts, public assistance, or disability pensions

---

### Percentage of Individuals Age 65 and older

- Census Population Estimates
  + 2014 for 2016 estimates
  + 2018 for 2020 estimates
- Used the same formula as the Latinx and Black/African American percentages.


### Percentage of adults in Poor/Fair Health

- Adults that consider their health to be of poor or fair status
- Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
  + 2014 for 2016 estimates
  + 2017 for 2020 estimates
- Adjusted based on age

---

### Access to Recreational Resources

- Access assessed through the percentage of individuals in a given county that live close to a location to engage in physical activity
- Proximity to recreational resources were considered:
  + In a census block that was within a half mile of a park
  + In an urban census block that is within one mile of a recreational facility
  + In a rural census block that is within three miles of a recreational facility
- Business Analyst, Delorme map data, ESRI, and United States Census Tigerline Files
  + 2010 and 2014 for 2016 estimates
  + 2010 and 2019 for 2020 estimates
    + 2010 values are of populations within census blocks
    + 2014 and 2019 values are of adequate access
- Changed from access to exercise opportunities to access to recreational resources

???

_recreational facilities include gyms, pools, dance studios, and community centers_

---

### Leisure-time Physical Activity

- Assessed by the number of individuals in a given county that engaged in some leisure-time physical activity
- Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System aggregated into the CDC's Diabetes Interactive Atlas (2012) and the United States Surveillance System (2016)
  + 2012 for 2016 estimates
  + 2016 for 2020 estimates
- Originally a measure of physical inactivity; however subtracted the percentage of inactivity to get percentage of those engaging in leisure-time physical activity
- “During the past month, other than your regular job, did you participate in any physical activities or exercises such as running, calisthenics, golf, gardening, or walking for exercise?” 

???

_LTPA because we wanted to focus on PA that was engaged from individuals desires rather than for occupation_

# Analytic Plan

---

# Analyses

- Two-level models with counties (level 1) nested within states (level 2)
- Random-intercept and random-slope models
  + The slopes of the associations for the states do not differ
  + The slopes of the associations between access and leisure-time physical activity are allowed to differ by state
- Maximum likelihood Estimation
- Likelihood ratio tests will be conducted to examine differences between competing models
  + A significant test will assess whether the inclusion/exclusion of fixed and random effects resulted in a better fitting model
- Intraclass correlation coefficients will assess how much variation is from differences between states in random-intercept models

# Addressing Missing Data

- Multiple imputation through fully conditional specification will be conducted (Enders et al., 2016)
  + This technique uses the complete data to estimate an outcome with missing values then re-estimates an inverted model where the outcome in the previous model is a predictor of the inverted model
$$ y = x + z $$
$$ x = y + z $$

- Multilevel imputation is required to address the nested nature of the data, as single-level imputation would result in biased estimates (Grund et al., 2018)

---

# Model Assumptions

- Multilevel models' assumptions are slightly different from traditional regression models (i.e., OLS)

- Assess linearity of the associations tested (ecological predictors and leisure-time physical activity)

- Examine univariate and multivariate normality

- Test homoscedasticity by examining residual variance 

- Investigate for outliers in data

---

# Expected Implications

### Practice &amp; Policy

- This study's findings will provide information to state health departments on which correlates may need to be considered for their state
- State health departments could use the patterns in leisure-time physical activity levels to see where their state ranks compared to surrounding states
  + This could lead to potential collaboration efforts between states with lower leisure-time physical activity levels
- By examining multiple years, this study's findings could examine if national policies implemented in this study resulted in changes to leisure-time physical activity
  + [US National Physical Activity Plan](https://www.physicalactivityplan.org/theplan/about.html)


### Research

- By utilizing the socio-ecological model, multilevel modeling, and by examining several correlates at once, this study could lead future studies to utilize these modeling techniques to examine other associations between states
  + State differences in these associations (e.g., crime and leisure-time physical activity) could then inform policies to implement prevention/intervention efforts focused on these specific correlates
- Differences between states' access to recreational resources could lead to future research examining the driving forces behind lower access within each state, which could then lead to policy changes to inform access, which may then influence leisure-time physical activity levels

---

# Strengths &amp; Limitations

### Strengths

- First study to examine correlates of access and physical activity using national data
- Will be able to examine association between access and physical activity nationally and across states

### Limitations

- Inability to examine the data longitudinally
- Limitations in how the measures are assessing each construct
  + self-reported leisure-time physical activity
  + estimates could be representative of modeling techniques in smaller counties and counties with low response rates
